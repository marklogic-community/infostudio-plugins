MarkLogic Server 4.2 introduces Information Studio, which provides a framework for creating custom plugins.

collector-rss.xqy : ingests an rss feed
collector-twitter.xqy : ingests tweets from the public timeline
collector-zip.xqy : ingests a directory of .zip files, unzipping them and saving the contents to the database
